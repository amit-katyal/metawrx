# Web 3.0 NFT Marketplace

In this project, we created a web 3.0 application with the help of Tailwind CSS, Next.js, Sanity.io etc. Our ultimate goal was to set up a blockchain-based marketplace where individuals could mint their own NFTs and grow their unique personalized NFT collections. As a result, they were able to trade and acquire their own NFTs simply within the interface. We also implemented Metamask authentication for the secure service. While working on the front end, users also made updates to the stored data in the collections on blockchain and NFTs. We aspired to create this web 3.0 app on the Ethereum blockchain and then release it to the public.

## Features

- Mint your own NFTs with custom metadata and images
- Browse and filter NFT collections by categories, prices, popularity and more

- Manage your NFT portfolio and track your transactions
- Connect your Metamask wallet for secure and easy access
